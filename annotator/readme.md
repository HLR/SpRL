# How to used for segmentation
- Open `annotator/annotator.htm` file in the browser
- Choose the relations file provided in the root folder
- Choose the phrases file provided in the root folder
- Click load, now you should see the list of image names in the left column
- Click on one image name, you will see the list of relations for that image(if there isn't any means that image does not have any relation)
- Click on blue/red boxes of each relation to see the box in the image, you can see the coordinates on top of the image
- If the clicked box does not have any box in the image, you can click on the image and draw a box for it
- To apply the change, click on apply(for each box you should do that)
- after finishing with your changes, click `save` to save the changes
- you can use this file later on to continue you work(this is the phrases file, the relations file will not change so you just need to load the original one)
